# pocket-peds
PocketPeds is a pediatric dosing app catered towards individuals who are not medically literate. 

This application was created to combat the problem of increased incidence of errors in pediatric dosing.
These errors in preexisting dosing apps are due to a lack of standardized definitions & terminology in literature,
standardized instruments for patients, and health literacy in caregivers.

There are multiple factors influencing calculations. These factors include current and/or gestational age,
weight and/or body surface area, and chronic disease status or clinical condition.
